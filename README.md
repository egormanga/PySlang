# Slang

**Slang** is an imperative/event-driven object-oriented programming language.

It is packed with the best bits taken from all the languages I know of, either appreciated or not _(I do look at you JS)_.

For example, C has pretty good (not to say brilliant) language _syntax_ design: just try to count all major C-like languages on your fingers ;).
Slang, which implements similar syntax, takes it to a whole another level, superpowered by its features.

It _probably_ has its own bad sides, though â€” yet to figure those out (and hopefully, eliminate).

But **performance** will ever be and **remain a consideration**, least to say.
